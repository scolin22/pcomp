rndb kernel
Reusing myRandState stored in local memory was an improvement over
reusing randState stored in global memory.

perc kernel
Whenever possible, I copied variables in global/shared memory to
local memory such as the shared data. This comes with a cost of extra
memory reads, but savings come from repeated read and writes of local
memory.
